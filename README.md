# personal-portfolio

This is a personal portfolio webpage that shows my projects both on github and on netlify. It also has some links to my personal social media links. 

This portfolio web app was built with reactjs library and bootstrap framework and also the create vite@latest. i prefer to use vite as it is faster to install and has lower space than the create-react-app. I learned how to work with bootstrap on react in this project.


to get the code, clone the repo and run npm install to install the node modules and npm run dev to see it in the browser.
